# Broadway-Gender-Equity
Exploring gender equity available to Broadway and Off-Broadway musicians

## Hypotheses:

  Gender influences a person’s opportunities in the music industry.
	gender influence a person’s choice to have music as their main profession
  gender influences the highest degree earned by a musician
  gender and touring history are not independent
  gender influences a person’s decision to become a composer and/or arranger
  gender influences the decision to attain a degree in something other than music
  gender is tied to the attainment of student loans
  The choice to have a second career is not independent of gender
  Gender is not independent of marital status
  Having dependents is not independent of gender
  gender is not independent from living situation
  gender is not independent of  job security
  Gender is not independent of the anxiety of job security
  
## Methods:
These hypotheses will be tested using Chi-Squared tests. A chi-square test for independence compares two variables in a contingency table to see if they are related. In other words, it tests to see whether distributions of categorical variables differ from each other. If the test returns a p-value of less than 0.05, that means there is a statistically significant association between the variables.
This test can be used on groups of unequal sizes where groups have more than ~5 participants. To fit this accomodation,  transgender man (1), non-conforming(7), and write-in(1) have been combined to create a "nonbinary" gender category. 

## Results (so far):
Gender is associated with touring history, and whether or not a person is a composer or arranger. There is enough evidence to show that a relationship exists between gender and touring history, (p=8.7e-08), gender and composing (p=0.0005491), and gender and arranging (p=0.0005491).

No other hypothesis was shown to be correct using the chi-squared method
